* Don't break existing behaviour. Backward compatibility is 
  extremely important.

* New feature proposals should be described with acceptance tests 
  and ideally discussed with the group before implementation.

* Follow the style and conventions of the existing code (basically
  Sun's conventions). In particular: Use spaces not tabs; Always use 
  braces after "if" statements.

* All code changes should have automated tests of some sort.

* Never check a failing test into the repository.
