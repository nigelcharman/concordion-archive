<h3>Who developed Concordion?</h3>
<p>
Concordion was developed by <a class="externalLink" href="http://www.davidpeterson.co.uk">David&nbsp;Peterson</a>,
an agile consultant based in London, UK. The idea was sparked by conversations with testers and developers, in particular
<a class="externalLink" href="http://nat.truemesh.com/">Nat&nbsp;Pryce</a> and
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.m3p.co.uk">Steve&nbsp;Freeman</a>,
while working at Easynet (BSkyB) in 2006.
</p>

<p>
You can contact David by e-mail at: <b>david@crowdsoft.com</b>, but please use the
<a class="externalLink" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/concordion/join">mailing&#160;list</a> for questions about Concordion itself.
</p>


<a name="licensing"> </a>
<h3>How is Concordion licensed?</h3>
<p>
    Concordion is licensed under the Apache License, v2.0.
    See <a href="Licence.html">here</a> for the license text.
</p>

<a name="mailingList"> </a>
<h3>Is there a mailing list?</h3>
<p>
    Yes, on Yahoo Groups. <a class="externalLink" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/concordion/join">Join here</a>
</p>

<a name="sourceCode"> </a>
<h3>Where is the source code repository?</h3>
<p>
    It is hosted on Google Code: <a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/concordion/">Project Page</a>,
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/concordion/source/browse">Browse Source</a>. The current
    development version (potentially unstable) can be exported as follows:
</p>
<pre>svn export http://concordion.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/concordion</pre>


<a name="comparisonWithFit"> </a>
<h3>How does Concordion differ from the Fit Framework and FitNesse?</h3>
<p>
The Fit Framework was the inspiration for Concordion. I used it for a
couple of years before I decided to develop Concordion with the following
aims:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Improved readability of documents</li>
<li>More "opinionated" (scripting is actively discouraged)</li>
<li>Easier to use</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I've tried to do in Concordion is place a stronger emphasis on writing
specifications of requirements, rather than test scripts. When you
use Concordion, the scripting needed to test the requirement is
hidden in the fixture code. I've explained this <a href="Technique.html">elsewhere</a>
but basically the reason you want to make a distinction is that it
means you can change the implementation and know that you are still
meeting the requirement. Test scripts mix up the requirement with
implementation details.
</p>

<p>
(See "<a href="ScriptingMakeover.html">Scripting&nbsp;Makeover</a>"
for a typical example of a FitNesse acceptance test and my take at
a Concordion equivalent specification.)
</p>


<p>
You can write active specifications with Fit, but it doesn't
make it easy for you. Because of the way Fit uses inheritance, its
fixture code is cumbersome, so developers tend to write as few fixtures
as possible. This leads to generic fixtures that can be used in
multiple specifications. Though this sounds like a good thing, it usually
means that the examples in the specifications are copy-and-paste jobs
and not well-focused.
Irrelevant detail causes all the problems associated with duplication
as well as making the examples harder to follow.
In addition, having generic fixtures tends to lead to scripting.
</p>

<p>
With Concordion the fixture code is much simpler and every specification
has its own unique fixture. Because you're not sharing fixtures, it
encourages you to focus the examples in the specifications much more
carefully. To remove duplication across fixtures, you build a simple
scripting API that the fixtures call into.

<h3>How does Concordion differ from Selenium?</h3>
<p>
<a class="externalLink" href="http://www.openqa.org/selenium-core/usage.html">Selenium</a>
is a test scripting tool for driving web browsers.
Concordion is a specification tool and hides scripting activity inside
Java fixture code. My recommended tool for controlling web browsers
from Java code (i.e. the one I've used) is
<a class="externalLink" href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/">WebDriver</a>, though
it may be possible to use Selenium in "driven mode" as an alternative.
</p>


<a name="scriptVsSpecify"> </a>
<h3>What is the difference between scripting and specifying?</h3>
<p>
See <a href="Technique.html">here</a> for an explanation.
</p>


<a name="groovyJRuby"> </a>
<h3>Why not use Groovy, JRuby or some other scripting language in
the instrumentation?</h3>
<p>
Experience from trial and error.
</p>
<p>The first prototype of Concordion did indeed use Groovy in the
instrumentation. With that kind of power available I found that I
couldn't help putting scripting into the instrumentation. At first
this was fine, but after a while I found that I was frequently having
to change the instrumentation during refactoring. The IDE didn't
give much assistance and I realised what I was doing was a mistake.
</p>
<p>
The place for scripting is in the Java fixture code, not in the
instrumentation. Once this realisation dawned on me, having a
powerful expression language in the instrumentation was pointless,
at best, and dangerously misleading, at worst, so I worked to cut
the language down to a bare minimum. The only thing the
instrumentation needs to do is call methods on the fixture.
All the scripting logic should be in the fixture.
</p>
<p>
This separation of concerns means that the HTML files rarely change
and you have the full power of Java for scripting and removing
duplication. It also means that you can hook the specification in
at any level you like from unit to system level without having to
change the instrumentation. For example, you might gradually move
your tests from testing through the UI to testing the domain layer
directly as it emerges.
</p>

<a name="htmlClumsy"> </a>
<h3>Isn't HTML a bit clumsy?</h3>
<p>
Yes, it is a bit, but not nearly as much as you might think. Once you have
a page template (there's one in the tutorial) you just have to fill in the
wording. You don't have to use many tags; &lt;p&gt;, &lt;span&gt;, &lt;table&gt;,
&lt;tr&gt;, &lt;th&gt;, and &lt;td&gt; are probably all you need. Improved
IDE tool support is on my to-do list, however.
</p>
<p>
Concordion works well where authorship of the documents is a collaborative
effort (developer + tester + analyst) rather than something that analysts
or testers do on their own. If you produce the specifications as a group
there'll usually be someone who's comfortable writing HTML. If not, it's not
particularly difficult to learn.
</p>

<a name="whyNotWiki"> </a>
<h3>Why not use a wiki or Word documents instead?</h3>
<p>
I shied away from a Wiki because it involves much more set-up and maintenance.
Wikis also tend to have poor version control.
</p>
<p>
The advantage of HTML over Word docs is that it's easier to link between
pages and it's a more open format.
</p>

<a name="extension"> </a>
<h3>Can I extend Concordion with my own commands?</h3>
<p>
Currently the facility for adding your own commands is not
enabled, though the software is designed to support this in
the near future. In the mean-time, let me know your suggestions.
</p>

<a name="storyDrivenProcess"> </a>
<h3>Can you outline a story-driven process with Concordion?</h3>
<p>
<img style="padding: 10px 0px 28px 0px;" src="image/faq/StoryDeliveryLifecycle.png"
  alt="Story Delivery Lifecycle (diagram)"/>
</p>


<p>
This process has worked well for me.
Writing specifications removes ambiguity so that when the product
owner decides, "OK, that's good enough for this iteration", there's
agreement about exactly what "done" means.
</p>

<p>
Locking down the scope gives stability. If you didn't think of something
during the initial discussion it can probably wait until the next
iteration. If not, you can agree as a team to add it, but behaviour
can't just be "slipped in" casually.
</p>

<a name="untestable"> </a>
<h3>What can't Concordion test?</h3>
<p>
Lots of things (e.g. how pretty a user interface is). However, as
a rule of thumb, if you can test it with JUnit then you can test it
with Concordion.
</p>

<a name="miniWaterfall"> </a>
<h3>Is your recommended process like a series of mini waterfalls?</h3>
<p>
No. It's acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).
The concrete examples in active specifications are acceptance
tests. The idea is that you write them before you write the code.
</p>

<p>
The <a class="externalLink" href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a>
says there is "value in the items on the right" but they "value the items on the left more".
Concordion helps you to support and boost the items on the left
by extracting the value from the items on the right
without succumbing to their downsides.
</p>


<a name="ownDogFood"> </a>
<h3>Does Concordion itself have active specifications?</h3>
<p>
Yes, it has <a target="specs" href="dist/1.2.0/test-output/concordion/spec/concordion/command/assertEquals/AssertEquals.html">quite a few</a>.
Obviously to begin with I didn't have the tool, so there are a lot of gaps!
