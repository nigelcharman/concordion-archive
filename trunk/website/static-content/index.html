<ul class="keyBenefits">
<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Powerful, yet simple to use</span>
Concordion integrates <i>directly</i> with JUnit.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Highly readable tests</span>
Concordion acceptance tests are so readable they can double up
as system documentation. And, since the tests are linked
to the system, you&#160;know the documentation is always up-to-date.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
<span class="keyPoint">Separates tests from implementation</span>
Tests that include a lot of implementation detail lock you into
that implementation. Concordion helps you to document the logic
and behaviour of your system in a way that does not lock you in.

<h1 style="width: 660px">What's special about it?</h1>

<h2>Plain English specifications</h2>
<p>
    Rather than forcing product owners to specify requirements in a
    specially structured language, Concordion lets you write them in plain
    English using paragraphs, tables and proper punctuation. This makes the
    specifications much more natural to read and write, and helps everyone
    to understand and agree about what a feature is supposed to do.
</p>


<h2>Always bang up-to-date</h2>
<p>
    Concordion specifications are <b>active</b>. Behind the scenes, they are
    linked to the system under test and therefore do not go out-of-date. If
    a change is made to the system's behaviour then the tests associated
    with the relevant specification will fail and let you know.
</p>


<p>
    <img src="image/concept/AnatomyOfAnActiveSpec.png"/>
</p>

<h2>Complex behaviours can be decomposed</h2>
<p>
        Each question at the bottom of the specification links to another
        active specification and so on until you have either run out of questions
        or the answer is "Out of Scope". In this way, a complex behaviour can
        be broken down into small, focused and easily understood requirements.
</p>


<br />

<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>
    <img style="padding-top: 24px; padding-bottom: 20px;" src="image/concept/HowItWorks.png"/>
</p>

<p>
Specifications are written in simple HTML.
Developers instrument the concrete examples in each specification with
commands (e.g. "set", "execute", "assertEquals") that allow
the examples to be checked against a real-life system.
</p>

<p>
The instrumentation is invisible to a browser, but is processed by a
Java fixture class that accompanies the specification and
acts as a buffer between the specification and the system under
test. The fixture is also a JUnit test case, so it's easy to run and
integrate into an automated build. The results of running the examples are
exported with green and red indicating successes and failures.
</p>

<p>
Some example instrumentation:
</p>

<pre class="html">
&lt;p&gt;
    When &lt;span <b>concordion:set="#firstName"</b>&gt;Bob&lt;/span&gt; logs in a greeting
    &lt;span <b>concordion:assertEquals="greetingFor(#firstName)"</b>&gt;Hello Bob!&lt;/span&gt;
    should be displayed.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>


<br />

<h1>Technique</h1>

<p class="subtext">
    With the right technique, active specifications can boost agility and make it
    easier to sustain a test-driven approach.
</p>

<h2>Separating requirements from implementation helps refactoring</h2>
<p>
Hiding all the implementation-specific detail inside the Java fixture
code gives you freedom to
change the internal design of
your application confident that you'll catch inadvertent changes
to required behaviour. The specifications don't
change when you refactor.
</p>

<p>
One problem with unit tests is that they mix together
customer requirements with tests of internal classes. With active
specifications you make a clear distinction and it's much easier to know
what's truly important and what can be changed. The specifications
describe the customer requirements whereas the unit tests verify internal
implementation.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be as thorough as unit tests</h2>
<p>
Specifications can cover every nuance of behaviour that is important
to the customer. There is no reason why the specifications cannot do
this to the same depth as JUnit tests. But instead of the onus being
on the developer to think up all the fine-detail tests, with active
specifications, testers and analysts can also get involved.
</p>

<h2>Specifications can be hooked in at different levels</h2>
<p>
The fixture code can be hooked in at unit, component, sub-system or
system level depending on the level of confidence required traded
against speed of test execution. The decision does not affect the
specifications themselves. They just describe the behaviour without
explaining how it's implemented or how to test it.
</p>


<h2>Agreeing details up-front allows finer control over scope</h2>
<p>
Active specifications can be used to define detailed acceptance criteria
for a story. This allows the product owner to make decisions about
scope and behaviour that would otherwise be left to the programmers.
This reduces gold-plating and allows the product owner to make conscious
trade-offs of scope against development cost. E.g. "Let's not handle
this [edge case] in this iteration as it's very unlikely to happen,
and there are other stories that I want implemented that offer more
value".
</p>



<h2>Test coverage no longer relies on developer self-discipline</h2>

<p>
Automated unit tests, written by developers, are at the heart of most
traditional agile approaches. Unfortunately, because unit tests are
neither visible to management nor the product owner, there's always
a feeling of pressure to cut corners for short-term gains in
development speed. In the long-term this can be fatal for agility,
but it takes constant willpower to resist the temptation and many
agile projects eventually succumb.
</p>

<p>
Driving a project with active specifications reduces
this problem. Since the specifications are written in plain English,
not only are they readable and visible outside of the development
team, but they are also co-authored with the product owner and
testers. Keeping the quality high becomes a group effort.
</p>

<p>
Developers may continue to write some unit tests to drive aspects
of the internal design but the project no longer relies on them for
test coverage of external behaviour. The active specifications
take over that role. Since writing the specifications is at the core
of the visible process &#8211; nothing is developed without active
specifications describing the requirements &#8211; it becomes practically
impossible to cut corners.

<h1>Spelling of Concordion</h1>

<p>
   Several people have told me that they couldn't find this page when they
   searched because they were, quite understandably, spelling "Concordion"
   as Concordium or Concordian. Hopefully, now I have written the words
   Concordium and Concordian on this page the search engines will find it
   even with the misspelling.
