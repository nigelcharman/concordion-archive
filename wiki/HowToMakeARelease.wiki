#summary How to make a release of Concordion

= Introduction =

Using [http://maven.apache.org Maven] and [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin maven-release-plugin] we can automate part of the process of a release.

By executing `mvn release:prepare ` we get:
  # a revision in the trunk without -SNAPSHOT
  # a tag named concordion-"version"
  # a revision in the trunk with the new version plus -SNAPSHOT

== Pre-conditions == 

All the changes have to be committed to SVN.
